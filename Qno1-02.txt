Sir, In this code only one thing which I am unable to fix is that
whenever I given a set of even numbers, the compiler is giving me the 
last two digits which I have input as lucky winnners whereas the odd 
numbers set is giving me the correct middle value as lucky winner and
one more thing in this code sir. I dont have DevC as I told you before
and I have done it using Programmiz C Compiler also my vs code is not 
compiling my code so it is correct I have made it by myself and little 
bit of error help from chatgpt and bard sp kindly run it on your device
and last thing I was unable to open the file input system in all codes
so instead of giving file input I took the user input method. Thanks
