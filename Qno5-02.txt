SORRY SIR I COULD NOT DONE QUESTION NO 04 I TRIED SO MANY
TIMES BUT I COULD NOT DO IT ITS A BIT TOUGH

Here is the code of finding the3rd last element of the list 
which of as usual given by the user input and whenever the elements
in the list is less than 3 so it will automatically return -1 or
that the list is not sufficient to find the 3rd last element.
